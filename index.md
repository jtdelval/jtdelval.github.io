# About

I'm a computer science masters student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I previously got my bachlors in Data Science from the same university with a minor in psychology, and I'm interested in Data Science and and Software Engineering as a career.

Outside of work and academics, I'm an avid fan of magical realist literature, travel, animation, and writing.
